**Case of 3 Enterprises Benefiting from Preferential Electricity Prices of 1.2 Trillion VND: Who Aided the Violations?**

**THÂN HOÀNG**

Three enterprises, despite not meeting the conditions, were still included in the list to benefit from preferential electricity prices, resulting in over 1.2 trillion VND in losses for the Vietnam Electricity Group (EVN). Which former officials have been accused of misconduct and assisted in this?

Mr. Hoàng Quốc Vượng, Mr. Nguyễn Danh Sơn, and Mr. Phương Hoàng Kim

The Supreme People's Procuracy has issued an indictment prosecuting former Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Hoàng Quốc Vượng for allegedly facilitating certain enterprises to benefit from preferential electricity prices, causing losses to EVN of over 1 trillion VND. Along with Mr. Vượng, defendant Phương Hoàng Kim (former director of the Department of Electricity and Renewable Energy) and seven others have been indicted for abusing their positions and powers while performing their official duties. Additionally, three defendants from the Tax Department of Bình Phước Province, Mr. Nguyễn Duy Khánh (former deputy director), Trần Văn Định (former head of the department), and Phạm Quang Vinh (former deputy chief) have been indicted for negligence causing severe consequences.

According to the indictment, Mr. Hoàng Quốc Vượng was directly responsible for directing and advising the drafting of Decision No. 13/2020 from the Prime Minister regarding mechanisms to encourage solar power development in Vietnam. During its implementation, Mr. Vượng was fully aware of the government’s policies and the Prime Minister's directives regarding support mechanisms for Ninh Thuận Province and solar power projects in meetings held on this issue.

However, for personal gain, Mr. Vượng allegedly abused his assigned powers, deliberately directing the Department of Electricity and Renewable Energy to draft a proposal to expand the scope of beneficiaries who would enjoy preferential electricity prices. At that time, the Chairman of the Board of Trung Nam Renewable Energy Co., Ltd. visited the Ministry of Industry and Trade to solicit Mr. Vượng's assistance in enabling the Trung Nam - Thuận Nam Solar Power Plant project to access a preferential electricity price of 9.35 US cents/kWh. Concurrently, this business leader also met with Director Phương Hoàng Kim to expedite the addition of this project into the adjusted Power Plan No. VII.

The Supreme People's Procuracy alleges that the former deputy minister agreed to the proposal for the Trung Nam - Thuận Nam Solar Power Plant project to be approved for the additional planning and sought a price mechanism of 9.35 US cents/kWh for this project.

The investigation concluded that two projects did not meet the necessary conditions but were still approved to benefit from preferential electricity pricing—namely, the Nhơn Hải Solar Farm and the Trung Nam - Thuận Nam Solar Power Plant. From 2020 to 2024, EVN purchased electricity and made payments exceeding 4 trillion VND to both of these solar power plants at preferential rates, resulting in a loss of over 1 trillion VND.

The prosecuting agency determined that Mr. Hoàng Quốc Vượng "for personal gain" created mechanisms for Trung Nam - Thuận Nam. Additionally, the former deputy minister is accused of "intentionally adjusting the wording, changing the scope of beneficiaries of the preferential electricity pricing policy" contrary to Resolution No. 115.

During the investigation, Mr. Vượng stated that he received a total of 1.5 billion VND from the aforementioned enterprise nine times. However, since the business owner denied giving money, the security agency separated this matter for further investigation.

**Facilitating Enterprises to Benefit from Preferential Electricity Prices**

In addition to the two projects mentioned, the Supreme People's Procuracy also identified that the Lộc Ninh 3 Solar Power Plant (Lộc Ninh 3 Energy Company) did not meet the requirements for official commercial operation status as per legal regulations. Nevertheless, to unjustly facilitate this plant's early operation to benefit from preferential electricity rates, defendants, former officials from the Electricity Regulatory Authority (Ministry of Industry and Trade) and the Power Trading Company (under EVN), still processed, approved, signed, and issued documents recognizing the commercial operation date for this plant.

The investigation revealed that on December 11, 2020, Lộc Ninh 3 submitted its application for a license through the online public service portal. On the same day, Mr. Nguyễn Anh Tuấn—head of the Electricity Regulatory Authority—delegated an employee to process the application.

Mr. Trịnh Văn Đoàn (a specialist in the licensing department) was accused of not drafting an inspection plan and failing to carry out a proper review of the enterprise as required. Nevertheless, Mr. Đoàn still prepared a report on the appraisal of the application for the operating license for Lộc Ninh 3, drafted the license, and presented it to superiors.

Mr. Trần Quốc Hùng (deputy head of the appraisal department) was fully aware that the project did not meet the licensing conditions but still initialed the request for the director’s approval. Mr. Nguyễn Anh Tuấn subsequently approved and signed the operating license for Lộc Ninh 3.

Mr. Nguyễn Danh Sơn (former director of the Power Trading Company) along with three subordinate officials knew that the plant did not meet requirements but still engaged in actions that enabled the enterprise to benefit from preferential pricing. As a consequence, the Power Trading Company purchased electricity and made payments to Lộc Ninh 3.Ninh 3 caused a loss of over 749 billion VND, resulting in nearly 210 billion VND in damages for EVN. Additionally, the deputy head of the Binh Phuoc Province Tax Department, along with two subordinates, has been accused of wrongdoing and negligence in processing tax refunds for the company, leading to a loss of 145 billion VND to the state budget. Mr. Tran Tuan Anh and Mr. Trinh Dinh Dung are identified as acting "without personal gain." The Supreme People's Procuracy has stated that it will not consider handling the cases of 15 officials at the Ministry of Industry and Trade, 5 people at the Ministry of Justice, 7 people at the Government Office, and several other related individuals. Among them are Mr. Tran Tuan Anh - former Minister of Industry and Trade (2016 - 2021), Mr. Trinh Dinh Dung - former Deputy Prime Minister, and Mr. Mai Tien Dung - former Minister and Head of the Government Office.

According to the indictment, former Minister Tran Tuan Anh is involved in signing the proposal that led to Decision No. 13/2020 by the Prime Minister regarding mechanisms to encourage the development of solar power in Vietnam, while former Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung is linked to signing Decision No. 13. Based on the investigation results, it was determined that both officials were not informed about the expanded scope of beneficiaries eligible for preferential electricity prices beyond the Resolution No. 115/NQ-CP and the directives of the Prime Minister. There is also no documentation or evidence indicating that Mr. Tran Tuan Anh, Mr. Trinh Dinh Dung, or Mr. Mai Tien Dung had "self-serving motives or personal interests" that unjustly facilitated support for the business (as stated in the indictment). Therefore, the procuracy does not consider taking action against Mr. Tran Tuan Anh, Mr. Trinh Dinh Dung, and Mr. Mai Tien Dung.

Former Deputy Minister Hoang Quoc Vuong testified that he received money from a solar power company on 9 occasions, totaling 1.5 billion VND. He stated that he was given gifts along with cash by the president of Trung Nam Thuan Nam Solar Power Company and their staff, with amounts ranging from 100 million VND on the lower end to 500 million VND on the highest occasion.
